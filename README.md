Gamechive

This project is based on the Mybrary tutorial project I completed, but with the added theme of a video game library. Due to my interest in playing video games, I decided to expand upon the Youtube tutorial project "Mybrary". The changes and additions I developed include but are not limited to: rebranding the pages to fit a video game theme, adding game related information such as publisher or playtime, and allowing the user to store additional information about the developing companies. This project may further expand in the future depending on inspiration.
